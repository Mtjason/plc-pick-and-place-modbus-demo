# Pick-and-Place Control Demo: OpenPLC + C++ Modbus TCP Client

This project demonstrates a minimal **Pick-and-Place control system** using [OpenPLC](https://www.openplcproject.com/) as the PLC runtime and a custom **C++ Modbus TCP client** for external control and monitoring.  
All code runs locally in WSL/Linux â€“ no physical PLC hardware is required.
